## Installation

Harvester can be installed using the [ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.3/install/iso-install/), a [bootable USB drive](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.3/install/usb-install), and [PXE boot](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.3/install/pxe-boot-install/). A [net install ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.3/install/net-install), which contains only the core OS components, is also now available. For more information, see the [Installation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.3/install/requirements) section of the documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Harvester v1.3.0 installer checks if the hardware meets the [minimum requirements](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.3/install/requirements/#hardware-requirements) for production use. If any of the checks fail, installation is stopped and warnings are printed to the system console.
> 
> You can disable this behavior during iPXE installation (for testing purposes) by adding the kernel parameter `harvester.install.skipchecks=true` when you boot the system. For more information, see [Useful Kernel Parameters](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.3/install/pxe-boot-install#harvesterinstallskipcheckstrue).

## Upgrade

Harvester only allows upgrades from supported versions. For more information about upgrade paths and procedures, see [Upgrading Harvester](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.3/upgrade/index).

> [!NOTE]
> Harvester will eventually support upgrading from v1.2.2 to v1.3.0. Once that version is released, you must first upgrade a Harvester cluster to v1.2.2 before upgrading to v1.3.0.

## Highlights

### vGPU Support

Starting with Harvester v1.3.0, you can use GPU cards that support the creation of virtual GPUs (vGPUs). In Kubernetes, a vGPU is a type of mediated device that allows multiple VMs to share the compute capability of a physical GPU. You can assign a vGPU to one or more VMs created by Harvester.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Although v1.3.0 supports vGPU usage, changes to the Rancher UI that would enable Harvester to effectively leverage vGPUs will only be available in v1.3.1. These changes include a new add-on for vGPU management and related settings on the VM configuration screen.

### Two-Node Clusters for High Availability

Harvester v1.3.0 supports two-node clusters for implementations that require high availability but without the footprint and resources associated with larger deployments. You can deploy either a two-node cluster with high availability, or a cluster with two management nodes and one witness node, which functions as an etcd node.

### Optimization for Frequent Device Power-Off/Power-On

Harvester v1.3.0 is optimized for environments wherein devices are frequently powered off and on, possibly because of intermittent power outages, recurring device relocation, and other reasons. In such environments, clusters or individual nodes are abruptly stopped and restarted, causing VMs to fail to start and become unresponsive. This release addresses the general issue and reduces the burden on cluster operators who may not possess the necessary troubleshooting skills.

### Managed DHCP

Harvester v1.3.0 allows you to configure IP pool information and serve IP addresses to VMs running on Harvester clusters using the embedded Managed DHCP feature. Managed DHCP, which is an alternative to the standalone DHCP server, leverages the vm-dhcp-controller add-on to simplify cluster deployment. The vm-dhcp-controller add-on reconciles CRD objects and syncs the IP pool objects that serve DHCP requests.

### ARM Support (Technical Preview)

You can install Harvester v1.3.0 on servers using ARM architecture. This is made possible by recent updates to KubeVirt and RKE2, key components of Harvester that now both support ARM64.

### Fleet Management (Technical Preview)

Starting with v1.3.0, you can use Fleet to deploy and manage objects (such as VM images and node settings) in Harvester clusters. Support for Fleet is enabled by default and does not require Rancher integration, but you can use Fleet to explore Harvester clusters imported into Rancher.
