## Installation

Harvester can be installed using the [ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.3/install/iso-install/), a [bootable USB drive](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.3/install/usb-install), and [PXE boot](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.3/install/pxe-boot-install/). A [net install ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.3/install/net-install), which contains only the core OS components, is also now available. For more information, see the [Installation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.3/install/requirements) section of the documentation.

## Upgrade

Harvester only allows upgrades from supported versions. For more information about upgrade paths and procedures, see [Upgrading Harvester](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.3/upgrade/index).

## Highlights

### vGPU Support

Starting with Harvester v1.3.0, you can use GPU cards that support the creation of virtual GPUs (vGPUs). In Kubernetes, a vGPU is a type of mediated device that allows multiple VMs to share the compute capability of a physical GPU. You can assign a vGPU to one or more VMs created by Harvester.

### Two-Node Clusters for High Availability

Harvester 1.3.0 supports two-node clusters for implementations that require high availability but without the footprint and resources associated with larger deployments. You can deploy either a two-node cluster with high availability, or a cluster with two management nodes and one witness node, which functions as an etcd node.

### Managed DHCP

Harvester v1.3.0 allows you to configure IP pool information and serve IP addresses to VMs running on Harvester clusters using the embedded Managed DHCP feature. Managed DHCP, which is an alternative to the standalone DHCP server, leverages the vm-dhcp-controller add-on to simplify cluster deployment. The vm-dhcp-controller add-on reconciles CRD objects and syncs the IP pool objects that serve DHCP requests.

### ARM Support (Technical Preview)

You can install Harvester v1.3.0 on servers using ARM architecture. This is made possible by recent updates to KubeVirt and RKE2, key components of Harvester that now both support ARM64.

### Fleet Management (Technical Preview)

Starting with v1.3.0, you can use Fleet to deploy and manage objects (such as VM images and node configuration) in Harvester clusters. Support for Fleet is enabled by default and does not require Rancher integration, but you can use Fleet to explore Harvester clusters imported into Rancher.
