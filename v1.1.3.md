## Installation

Harvester can be installed using the [ISO image](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1/install/iso-install/), a [bootable USB drive](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.2/install/usb-install), and [PXE boot](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1/install/pxe-boot-install/).

## Upgrades

You can [upgrade from v1.1.1 and v1.1.2 to v1.1.3](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1/upgrade/v1-1-1-to-v1-1-3).

## Bug Fixes

### General Fixes

- Users that create a namespace and then create volumes in the same namespace can view the new volumes on the Harvester UI. Previously, only the administrator was able to view the new volumes. See [issue #3874](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3874).

- When Harvester deletes an image file that is being uploaded, the corresponding temp file is also deleted. See [issue #4155](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/4155) and the [documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1/upload-image#known-issues).

### Upgrade Fixes

- The Harvester UI displays the available PCI devices after Harvester is upgraded and the pcidevices-controller addon is enabled. See [issue #3994](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3994).

- Upgrade log files are packaged correctly when users attempt to download the archive on the Harvester UI. The contents of the log files display as expected and the size of the archive is consistent each time the archive is downloaded. See [issue #4340](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/4340) and the [documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1/upgrade/troubleshooting#download-upgrade-logs).

### Installation Fixes

- The installer runs as expected when a network boot is performed using iPXE. See [issue #4767](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/4767).

- The ISO boots at a normal speed and displays the installer on Dell PowerEdge XR4000 servers. See [issue #4597](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/4597).

- The Harvester OS boots immediately when running on nodes with a Dell EMC BOSS-S1 card. See [issue #4334](https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/4334).
